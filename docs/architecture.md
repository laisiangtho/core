# Lai Siangtho — Phase 2 Architecture

Status: the Phase 1 feature set and its shell behaviour are ported (26.09.23.4) — see README.md for commands and layout. Phase 1 single-file `index.html` is preserved as git tag `v0.2.0`; Phase 2 intentionally drops the single-file / no-build-tools constraint.

Targets: web (PWA over HTTPS) and desktop (Electron), sharing one UI codebase.

## 1. Data contracts

Three data sources exist. Their **structure is frozen** (other applications consume them); content may change.

| File | Role | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| `category.json` | Canonical skeleton: testaments, sections, 66 books, chapter counts (`clue.c`), verse counts (`clue.v`), grouping (`guide`, `@guide: "testament.section.book"`), English names/abbr | Bundled in `public/` |
| `book.json` | Catalog of available translations | **Remote** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laisiangtho/bible/refs/heads/master/book.json`; bundled copy is a first-run seed only |
| `json/{identify}.json` | One translation (e.g. `tedim1932.json`) | Remote `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laisiangtho/bible/refs/heads/master/json/{identify}.json`; never bundled |

### 1.1 Catalog (`book.json`)

- Remote shape: `{ name, updated, version, book: [...], collection }`. Only `book[]` is app content; `updated` (ISO timestamp) and top-level `version` (integer, e.g. `260`) are used for change detection. `name` and `collection` are ignored by the app.
- Bundled `public/book.json` is currently a bare array (12 entries) — a different shape from remote (64 entries). A remote catalog, once fetched, **fully replaces** the local one.
- The catalog parser accepts exactly two known shapes (remote object, legacy bare array) and throws a descriptive error on anything else. Preferred end state: bundled copy regenerated as a trimmed snapshot of the remote object so only one shape exists.
- Entry `version` types are inconsistent (remote: 62 integers, 2 strings — `jwmynwt`, `bbe1949`; bundled: all strings). Versions are normalised with `Number()`; a non-numeric result is a validation error, not a silent pass.
- Entry fields: `identify, name, shortname, year, language{text, textdirection, name}, version, description, publisher, contributors, copyright`.

### 1.2 Translation file

Top level: `info, note, digit, language, testament, story, book`.

- `info.identify` must equal the requested identify; `info.version` (integer) is compared with the catalog entry `version` for update detection. For `tedim1932` both are `3`.
- `book[id].info` — localized `name, shortname, abbr[], desc`. Localization is incomplete in places (e.g. Tedim Isaiah: `name: "Isaiah"`, `abbr: []`).
- `book[id].chapter[c].verse[v]` — `{ text, title?, ref?, merge? }`.
- `story[book][chapter][verse]` — pericope heading `{ text, ref }`, `ref` in OSIS-like form (`Gen.1.1,Gen.2.25`).
- Size: full Tedim is 5.2 MB raw, 1.4 MB gzip on the wire. Raw host sends `access-control-allow-origin: *`, `cache-control: max-age=300`, and an `etag`.

### 1.3 Variations across published translations

Measured on tedim1932, niv2011, judson1835, ddb1931, bbe1949, jwmynwt, mizo1917; all parse under the validator.

- `jwmynwt` publishes `title`, `ref`, `merge` on every verse, mostly as `""`; empty strings are normalised to absent.
- `book[].topic` is `{}` or `[]`; unused.
- `bbe1949` has `info.version: "1"` (string).
- `ddb1931` has 1,039 merges and 153 chapters that differ from `category.json` verse counts; `bbe1949` 96.
- `info.shortname` can be `""` (jwmynwt); localised book names are sometimes English (mizo1917, niv2011).
- Parse time in Node: 50–170 ms per full translation.

### 1.4 Verse fields (measured on full `tedim1932.json`)

| Field | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | 30,715 | Verse text |
| `ref` | 3,235 | Cross-references, localized form: `Pian 22:2; La 2:7; Mat 3:17; 12:18`, `Mat 7:28-29` |
| `title` | 2,329 | Section sub-heading shown before the verse |
| `merge` | 272 | String: last verse number included in this verse. Covered verse keys are absent. |

- `merge` spans: +1 (235), +2 (19), +3 (8), +4 (2), +6 (4), +9, +11, +14, +26 (one each). Alignment must handle wide spans.
- Versification differs from `category.json` in 4 Tedim chapters: 1 Chr 19 (20 vs 19), John 7 (52 vs 53, 7:53 absent), 3 John 1 (14 vs 15), Rev 12 (17 vs 18). `category.json` drives navigation, not rendered rows.

---

## 1b. Language packs

`lang/iso-{code}.json` in the catalog repository names one language's
testaments, books (84, deuterocanon included), sections and digits, and carries
a `locale` block of interface strings. Packs are keyed by **ISO 639-3**.

The two-vs-three character problem solves itself: `book.json` uses 639-1
(`da`, `my`), but the translation files carry 639-3 in `info.language.name`
(`dan`, `mya`, `ctd`), so the pack key comes from the translation and no
mapping table is needed. A two-letter code names no pack and is not requested.

Every name the reader sees resolves in one order:

```
the translation file  →  the language pack  →  category.json (the canon, English)
```

The translation wins because it is the edition in front of the reader; the pack
fills in what that file omits; the canon is the last resort — and, being always
English, is also what every localised control offers as its accessible name.

Packs are cached in the records store (`lang:{code}`) and read from there on
later runs, so names never depend on being online; a cached pack older than 30
days is used immediately and re-fetched in the background. A missing pack is
normal, not a failure.

`locale` is not wired yet: those keys are the upstream app's, not this one's.
It is the obvious path to a translated interface, and the reason to keep the
pack service rather than inline the names.

## 2. Cross-reference resolution

- Translation files are **not** edited (a content change forces every consuming application to treat the file as modified).
- Resolution table per translation = translation `book[].info` (`name`, `shortname`, `abbr[]`) ∪ `category.json` `book[].info` (`name`, `shortname`, `abbr[]`).
- Measured on Tedim: 4,935 book-prefixed references, **1,488 (≈30%) unresolved** with that union. Top misses: `Thkna` 339, `Siam` 218, `Mang` 212, `Sawl` 183, `2Khang` 105, `2Kum` 97, `1Kum` 95, `1Kor` 63, `1Khang` 56, `Efe` 41.
- Gap closer: an **app-owned alias overlay**, one file per translation (`app/core/aliases/{identify}.json`, `{ "Siam": 3, "Mang": null, ... }`), applied before the two sources above. Neither `category.json` nor translation files change. `null` declares a known token without a confirmed mapping.
- Overlay maintenance: `scripts/aliases.mjs` (Node standard library; reuses `app/core` so the tool and the app share one parser). Dry-run by default; `--apply` writes. A mapping is written only when the token prefixes exactly one book name among books with a matching ordinal **and** ≥95% of cited chapter:verse locators fit that book; everything else is written as `null`.
- Tedim result: 69.5% resolved without overlay → 92.7% with it (`Mang` → 66 confirmed). `Thkna` and `Thna` remain `null`: the citations fit both Deuteronomy and Judges, so they stay plain text rather than risk a wrong link.
- Within a layer, primary names (name, shortname) outrank abbreviation variants: `category.json` lists "I Sa" for 1 Samuel, which normalises to "isa", the shortname of Isaiah.
- Grammar handled (measured on Tedim, Mizo, Judson): `;` separators; the Myanmar section mark `၊` as separator after a number; continuation parts inherit the previous book (`Mat 4:23; 9:35`); `:` and `.` chapter-verse separators (`24:14`, `24.14`); verse, chapter and chapter:verse ranges; comma lists; cross-book ranges (`1Sam 16:1-1Kum 2:11`); single-chapter books citing verses only (`File 10-12`); native digits via the translation's `digit` table; zero-width spaces inside tokens; trailing note words (`Thulu`).
- Unresolved parts render as plain text with the reason in a tooltip — never dropped, never fatal to rendering.

## 3. Storage

| Option | Decision |
|---|---|
| localStorage | Rejected — ~5 MB cap, synchronous, strings only |
| **IndexedDB** | **Chosen** — quota is a large share of free disk; available in workers; atomic transactions |
| OPFS | Deferred — same quota/eviction as IndexedDB; only worthwhile for SQLite-WASM full-text search later |
| File System Access API | Rejected as primary — Chromium only, permission prompts |
| Electron `fs` (`userData`) | Deferred — only if another app needs user-visible files |

Layout:

- Store `translations`: key `identify` → `{ info, note, digit, language, testament, story, books: {id → info}, version, installedAt, bytes, stats, diagnostics }`.
  `stats` is what the file holds (books, chapters, verses, merges, titles, refs); `diagnostics` is `{ total, items }` — where the file departs from the canon, capped at 400 entries so a translation missing most of the canon cannot bloat the record. Both are shown in the translation information popover and summarised on the library row, and the whole report can be saved as JSON.
- Store `settings`: key `'current'` → the persisted settings (see 3b).
- Store `chapters`: key `[identify, book, chapter]` → verses as published, normalised only where the data is inconsistent (empty optional strings removed, `merge` stored as a number).
- Install / update: a worker fetches, validates, splits and writes everything in **one readwrite transaction**; the previous copy remains until the new one commits.
- `navigator.storage.persist()` requested on first install. Safari evicts script-writable storage after 7 days of no interaction for non-installed sites; installed PWAs are exempt.
- UI shows per-translation size and "Remove offline copy".
- Electron uses the same IndexedDB code; the renderer is served from a custom `app://` protocol (standard + secure privileges), never `file://`.

---

## 3b. Settings and transfer

- Persisted settings (IndexedDB store `settings`, schema v2): `translation`, `book`, `chapter`, `parallel`. Validated and clamped against `category.json` on every read and write; unknown keys are an error.
- Writes are coalesced (250 ms) because chapter stepping fires rapidly.
- `boot` seeds the session state from settings and writes back only the persisted subset, so features may keep other state without it being stored.
- Export envelope: `{ app, schema, exportedAt, settings, library: { catalog, translations[] } }`. Translation text is excluded by design; import restores state and offers to re-download the listed translations.
- Import refuses a foreign `app` or an unsupported `schema` with a message naming both.
- Transfer uses plain browser APIs (`Blob` download, `<input type=file>`), shared by both targets; native OS dialogs remain a platform capability.

## 3c. Search, notes and bookmarks

- **Search**: no install-time index. A worker walks an IndexedDB cursor over `chapters` and streams matches in batches; a newer query cancels the older one. Measured in Chromium on the full data: one translation ≈ 1.0 s (5.2 MB, 1,189 chapters, 31k verses), two ≈ 2.0 s. An inverted index would cut query time at the cost of build time and storage; revisit if the wait becomes a problem.
- **Matching** (`core/search.js`): words ANDed, `"phrases"` literal, case and Latin-accent folding only (Myanmar, Arabic and Hebrew marks are meaning-bearing and kept). Fold positions map back to the original string so highlight ranges are correct.
- **Notes and bookmarks** (`core/annotations.js`) key on book/chapter/verse, never on a translation: an annotation belongs to the verse, so it shows in every translation. Notes: chapter-level or verse-level, several per verse, random ids. Bookmarks: one per verse, id derived from the passage. Both validate against `category.json` (unknown book, chapter out of range, unknown colour are errors).
- Stored in IndexedDB v3 (`notes`, `marks`), held in memory for the reading surface to consult per verse, and carried in the export under `data`. Import merges by id — nothing is dropped.
- The verse bar is the shell's; its buttons come from `registry.verseAction()`, so a build without a feature simply has fewer.
- Settings writes: only the reading position is coalesced; other changes write immediately, because a write started from `pagehide` is not reliably completed.

### 3b-i. Sidebar rows

A sidebar is a column of rows; each row has its own tab strip and shows one of
its panes. Settings hold `sidebarLeft` / `sidebarRight` as
`[{ views: [paneId], active, size }]` (`size` is a flex-grow share, frozen to
measured pixels when a divider drag starts so untouched rows keep their height).
Up to `MAX_ROWS` (4) rows a side.

Pane views are built and mounted **once** and parked in a holder when not on
show, so rearranging a sidebar never remounts a pane — a search with results in
it survives being dragged into another row, or to the other sidebar. Moving a
pane across sidebars hands the mounted node to the other side's holder.

Every pixel of a sidebar resolves to a drop: a strip means "join this row at
this index", a row body half means "make a new row above/below". Dropping the
last pane out of a row removes the row; heights are reset only when the row
count changes.

A settings **migration** handles the rename from 26.09.23.3's flat
`panesLeft` / `panesRight`: stored settings pass through `migrateSettings`,
which maps them to one row per side and drops keys this build no longer has,
reporting what it dropped. Imported files stay strict — they carry a schema
number and are someone else's data.

### 3b-ii. Narrow and touch layout

The stylesheet carried Phase 1's responsive rules from the start; this wires
them. At ≤900 px a sidebar arrives as a drawer over the text, with a scrim and
`body.drawer-l` / `drawer-r` / `has-drawer`; one at a time, and a window grown
back to a column layout closes whichever was open. At ≤760 px the status bar
gives way to a floating navigation pill (drawers, previous, next, palette), the
band carries the app pill, and the tab strip shows only the active tab — which
is why that tab carries a chevron: pressing it opens the tab switcher, the
modal listing every open tab plus "new" and "close".

### 3c-i. Feature records

Settings has a fixed schema, validated key by key; reading-plan progress, the study board and ink strokes do not fit it and are far larger. They live in IndexedDB v4 store `records` (key: the feature's name → its document), behind `services/records.js`: loaded once at startup, written through on change, carried in the export under `data.records`. Each feature owns exactly one key and is its only writer, so no two features can fight over a record.

| Key | Owner | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `plan` | plans | `{ id, start, read: { "book.chapter": when } }` |
| `board` | board | `{ cards: [{ x, y, w, h, title, text, colour }] }` |
| `ink` | ink | `{ "book.chapter": [{ colour, size, width, points }] }` |
| `composer` | composer | window geometry, mode, split ratio |
| `voices` | speech | chosen voice per language |

## 3d. Workspace, source mode and chrome

- **Versioning**: `yy.mm.dd.build`. `scripts/version.mjs` writes `app/version.js` (display), `package.json` (`yy.m.d`, the semver npm and electron-builder need) and electron-builder's `buildVersion`. The version appears in Settings, in the About command and in the export envelope.
- **Tabs** each carry their own passage; the active tab mirrors into the shared state that the tree, status bar and panes read. Tabs, the active index, sidebar widths, chrome toggles, typography and mode are all in settings, so a session reopens as it was left.
- **Detached windows** are in-app frames (`shell/floats.js`) holding the same leaf — or the same doc, mounted a second time — that the workspace builds. Not a second OS window: the web build has none, and one renderer keeps docked and floating from drifting apart.
- **Dragging** (`shell/dragdrop.js`) is pointer-event based throughout: tab reorder, tab out of the strip (> 52 px below it) to detach with a preview of the window it would become, a detached window dragged back over the strip to dock, sidebar pane tabs reordered / moved to another row / moved to the other sidebar / dropped into a body half to split it, pane heads to swap panes, sidebar edges and row dividers to resize. Two rules hold every drag together, and both were learned from defects:
  - `pointermove` / `pointerup` are listened for on the **window**, not on the dragged element, and come off in one place. Listening on the element loses the drag the moment the pointer outruns it, and leaves the class, the ghost and the drop marks on screen.
  - **Nothing is re-rendered mid-drag.** The model changes once, on release. Re-rendering per move destroyed the element under the pointer: the drag stopped, the caret stayed behind, and the order was never committed — exactly the "dragging stops working and leaves a mark" report.
- **Tab reorder** follows Phase 1's feel: the dragged tab tracks the pointer, the others slide by exactly one tab width to open the gap, and the splice happens on release.
- **The reading panel** is built once and only its values are repainted; geometry is set when it opens, so clicking inside it cannot make it move under the pointer. It carries the popover arrow (`--arrow-x`, `.is-above`) pointing at whatever opened it, and its reset is a quiet link in the foot rather than a button the size of the controls.
- **Source mode** (`core/source.js`) renders the chapter as Markdown and accepts edits only under `## Notes`; the scripture section is compared on save and a change is refused. Verse notes are `- **17** text`, the chapter note is loose text.
- **Strong's** (`core/strongs.js`) reads `{H7225}`, `<S>430</S>` and `[H430]`, attaching each code to the preceding word. No published translation carries the markup today, so the toggle reports that rather than appearing to do nothing. The regex is built per call — a shared `/g` regex carries `lastIndex` between `test()` and `matchAll()`, which silently skipped the first match until a test caught it.
- **Typography**: text size, line height and line length are CSS variables set from settings by the reading panel — on the **root element**, not the body. The ramp derives `--fs-text` from `--reading-size` at `:root`, and a custom property is resolved where it is declared, so setting them on the body moved every number in the panel while the text never changed.
- **Interface line height**: `body { line-height: 1.5 }`, unitless. With `line-height: normal` the line box comes from the font's own ascent and descent, and the Myanmar faces ask for close to twice the Latin metrics, so a button with a Burmese label grew taller than the same button in Latin. Unitless (not `1.5em` or `150%`) because a length inherits as a fixed number of pixels, which would give nested text at another size the wrong leading. Labels clipped to one line take `padding-block: 3px; margin-block: -3px` — ink room that costs no layout height.
- **Digits**: a number that names a chapter is written in the primary translation's own digits (`localizeNumber`) wherever it appears — tabs, breadcrumbs, the books tree, the status bar, the breadcrumb picker. A count (39 books, 30 verses) is a quantity and stays in the interface's digits.
- **Script typography**: the reading surface carries `lang` and `dir` from the translation. Files name their language by ISO 639-3 (`mya`, `ctd`), so the parser also reads `info.language.iso["639-1"]` and prefers it — `:lang(my)` never matches `lang="mya"`, which is why Burmese was rendering with Latin line spacing. Burmese stacks marks above the consonant, below it and beside it, and marks a killed consonant with an asat, so a line carries roughly twice the ink of a Latin one: it gets `calc(var(--lh-text) * 1.26)` — a multiple of the reader's own setting rather than a fixed number, so the reading panel still moves it — plus a Myanmar face stack. Arabic gets 1.12× the size and 1.16× the height. The language also reaches the element because the browser's own line breaker needs it: Burmese writes without spaces between words.
- **English behind every localised control**: any control whose visible text comes from the translation — tabs, breadcrumbs, the books tree, chapter chips, the chapter picker, the status bar's passage — carries the canon's English name as `title` and `aria-label`. A reader who cannot read the script can still tell what a click will open, and a screen reader announces something it can pronounce.
- **The crumb bar** reads translation ▸ testament ▸ book ▸ chapter, and ends with one button: what this translation is (description, language, publisher, copyright, the version held against the version listed, install date and size), and from there "Download again" — because a translation file can be corrected upstream without the catalog's version changing, and an installed copy would otherwise never hear about it. A copyright line pinned above the text is read once and then read past forever, while costing a strip of every chapter; behind a button it is one press from the text it describes and absent the rest of the time.
- **Names in the reader's language**: book names, and now testament names, come from the translation (`meta.testament[id].info.name`) wherever they are shown — tabs, breadcrumbs, the books tree, the chapter header — with the canon as fallback. Chrome that carries such a name is tagged with the script's language so it gets the same line room.
- **Chapter-only controls**: a command may declare `needsChapter`. While a document tab is active, `body[data-tab="doc"]` is set and those buttons are shown but not pressable — the nav arrows, the parallel-pane button, layout, source mode, Strong's, synchronised scrolling, ink, read aloud, verse card and chapter export — rather than failing when pressed.
- **An empty sidebar** keeps its place in the document: while a pane is being dragged it shows a rail to drop onto, and a pane dropped there opens that sidebar. Without it, the last pane moved out of a sidebar could never be moved back.
- **The Library** filters on name, abbreviation, language, publisher or year, and arranges itself by language, as one flat list, or as the offline set only; the choice is remembered.
- **Detached windows** remember the size and position they were last left at (records key `floats`), offset so a second window does not hide the first and clamped into the window as it is now.
- **Resize handles** draw no grip in any state: the grip's percentage offset resolved differently while a drag was running, which put a mark at the top of the window. The moving edge and the cursor are the feedback.
- **The status bar** reports what is being read — translation, passage, word count and verse count for the chapter on screen — and on the right the state the reader can click, ending with storage use (`navigator.storage.estimate()`), whose tooltip names the quota and whether the origin is persisted. Counts are measured from the chapter records actually in view, so they describe what is in front of the reader.
- **Help, Shortcuts and About** are documents (`features/help/`). The shortcut table is generated from the command registry, so it cannot describe a key this build does not bind; About reports the installed translations, their bytes, note and bookmark counts, storage use and eviction state.
- **The breadcrumb picker** (`shell/navpop.js`) opens the siblings of whichever crumb is pressed: the testament's books, or the book's chapters, marking the chapters the translation actually carries. Choosing a book moves to its chapters without moving the arrow.
- **Scroll fades** (`shell/fade.js`) set `--fade-top` / `--fade-bottom` on scrollable areas, so an edge with more beyond it fades rather than drawing a line. Nothing is dimmed when the content fits.
- **Icons**: `public/icons/icon.svg` is the source; PNGs at 1024/512/192/32 are derived for the manifest, the favicon and desktop packaging.

## 4. Catalog update flow

1. First run: bundled catalog, labelled with its date as potentially outdated.
2. Check remote on demand, or at most once per 24 h when online (`fetch` with `cache: 'no-cache'`).
3. Compare remote top-level `version` / `updated` with the stored catalog; unchanged → stop.
4. Validate shape; on failure show a clear error and keep the stored catalog (explicit, reported — not a silent fallback).
5. Per installed translation: `Number(catalog.version) > Number(installed.info.version)` → "update available". Installed but missing from catalog → kept, marked "no longer listed".
6. Download: validate `info.identify`, book ids against `category.json`, then atomic replace.

---

## 5. Parallel view

- Each translation yields spans per chapter: verse `n` → `[n, merge ?? n]`.
- Spans from all open columns are merged by overlap; each merged group is one **row**.
- A column cell holds all of its verses whose start falls inside the row. Missing verses render as an empty marked cell; extra verses form their own row.
- `story` and `verse.title` headings render inside the owning column's cell, so one translation's headings never shift other columns.
- A single CSS grid (one row per group) removes the need for JavaScript scroll syncing. Split panes, if kept, use row ids as scroll anchors.

## 6b. Phase 1 shell

`app/styles/shell.css` is Phase 1's stylesheet unchanged (1,578 lines: token ramp, chrome, reading surface, modal, status bar). The shell rebuilds that markup from the registry, so the design carries over without a rewrite:

- ribbon ← commands flagged `ribbon`; sidebar strips ← `registry.pane`; tabs ← chapters plus `registry.doc`.
- reading is the shell, not a feature: tabs, panes (leaves), breadcrumbs, the chapter surface.
- each verse, with its `story`/`title` headings and its references, is one `.vblock`; parallel rows are levelled per `alignChapter` group and synchronised scrolling follows the verse, not the pixel offset. Pane starts are levelled first, and `.chapter` carries a hair of padding so the first heading's margin cannot collapse through the measurement.
- theme, accent, verse layout, sync scroll and row alignment live in settings, so an export carries them.

Accent tokens are redefined per theme in the ramp (`html[data-theme="light"] …`), so a target's `theme.css` must match that specificity — a plain `:root` override loses.

Everything Phase 1 offered is now ported: notes and the composer, the notes manager, search, bookmarks, tags, backlinks, outline, the link graph, the study board, ink, reading plans, speech, verse cards, detached windows, tab and pane drag-and-drop, source mode and Strong's numbers.

Two behaviours are deliberately not Phase 1's:

- The board edits a card through a textarea laid over it, not `window.prompt`, which the desktop engine does not implement.
- The link graph is drawn from what the reader has touched — chapters carrying notes or bookmarks, the wikilinks between them, and the cross references printed in those chapters — rather than from a static table of chapter references. The whole canon would be tens of thousands of edges nobody can read.

## 7. Per-target customization

Rule: shared code under `app/` never asks which target it runs in. Variation is decided once, in `targets/*/main.js`, by **composition**.

```js
// targets/desktop/main.js
/**
 * Desktop (Electron renderer) build composition.
 *
 * Differs from the web build only in what is listed here: an extra feature
 * (export-chapter, which needs a native save dialog), the desktop platform
 * services, and the desktop theme.
 */
import { start } from '../../app/boot.js';
import library from '../../app/features/library/index.js';
import reader from '../../app/features/reader/index.js';
import parallel from '../../app/features/parallel/index.js';
import exportChapter from '../../app/features/export-chapter/index.js';
import { createPlatform } from './platform.js';
import './theme.css'; // after boot.js so target tokens override the defaults

start({
  root: document.getElementById('app'),
  createPlatform,
  features: [library, reader, parallel, exportChapter],
  config: {},
});
```

Mechanisms:

| Variation | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Feature on/off | Feature modules listed in the target entry. Unlisted features are tree-shaken out of the bundle. |
| Colours, spacing, typography | `app/styles/tokens.css` defines tokens; `targets/*/theme.css` overrides them. CSS only. |
| Native capabilities (dialogs, window, menus, external links, auto-update) | `platform` object injected at boot; features declare `requires: ['saveFile']`. |
| URLs, defaults, limits | Plain `config` object passed to `start`; unknown keys are rejected. |

Feature module contract:

```js
export default {
  id: 'export-chapter',
  requires: ['saveFile'],            // platform capabilities
  setup(ctx) { /* register commands, views, settings via ctx */ },
};
```

- The command palette, menus and settings are built from registered features, so an absent feature leaves no dead UI.
- `boot` throws at startup if a listed feature requires a capability the platform lacks (fail-fast, clear message naming feature and capability).
- `test/boundaries.test.js` fails the suite if any file under `app/` imports from `targets/` or references `electron`, `window.lai`, `import.meta.env.MODE` or compares `platform.id`; and if `app/core/` touches the DOM, storage, `fetch` or `import.meta.glob`.

Verified: the web bundle contains no export-chapter code; the desktop accent token appears only in desktop CSS.

Trade-offs accepted:

- Two small `index.html` shells (one per target) duplicate a few lines of markup.
- The feature registry adds one level of indirection; it is justified by per-target feature sets and by the existing command-palette model.

## 8. Build outputs

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `dist/web/` | Static PWA build |
| `out/` | Compiled Electron main/preload/renderer |
| `release/` | Installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`, AppImage) |

All three are git-ignored.

---

## 9. Security (desktop)

- Renderer: `contextIsolation`, `sandbox`, no `nodeIntegration`; preload exposes only `saveFile`, `openExternal`, `appInfo`, `checkUpdate` and the window-frame hint.
- IPC handlers reject senders whose frame origin is not the app's; inputs are validated; `openExternal` accepts `https:` only.
- `app://` handler normalises paths and refuses anything outside `out/renderer/` (traversal requests return 404/403).
- Navigation away from the app origin is blocked; `window.open` to `https:` opens in the system browser.
- Production CSP on both targets: scripts and styles from `'self'`; `connect-src` limited to `'self'` and `https://raw.githubusercontent.com`.

---

## 9b. Failure states and recovery

Every failure has a named cause and, where one exists, an action.

| What fails | What the reader gets |
|---|---|
| A feature throws while registering | The other features start; one message names the feature and the reason. Reading is never lost to a study tool. |
| A pane or document throws on mount | The error is rendered inside that pane's own body; the rest of the chrome is untouched. |
| Storage is full (`QuotaExceededError`) | A message naming the remedy (remove a translation, free space) instead of the browser's wording. Install is one transaction, so the previous copy survives. |
| Another window upgrades the database | `onversionchange` closes the connection and reports it once, rather than letting every later write fail on its own. |
| An upgrade is blocked by an older window | The open is refused with a message naming the cause. |
| The application cannot start at all | A screen with the message, **Try again**, and a two-press **Erase stored data** (`indexedDB.deleteDatabase`), with what erasing costs stated. |
| A chapter is missing from a stored copy | Told apart from a translation that omits the book: when the translation's own index lists the book, the copy is incomplete, and **Download again** repairs it in place. |

`shell.repairTranslation(identify)` is the single repair path, shared by that callout and the translation information popover. It reinstalls over the held copy; a failed attempt leaves what is stored alone.

---

## 9c. Keeping the application current

Neither target downloads anything without being asked. The mechanism differs and `app/features/updates/` knows neither: both arrive as platform capabilities, and a target with neither gets no command.

| Target | Capability | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Web | `updates` (`targets/web/register-sw.js`) | A new service worker installs and **waits**. The reader is offered *Reload*; `apply()` posts `take-over`, the worker calls `skipWaiting()`, and the one `controllerchange` reloads the page. Assets from two builds never mix. |
| Web | `install` | The browser's own install offer, held until the reader asks for it, rather than shown as a banner. |
| Desktop | `checkUpdate` | The **main process** queries the releases API and returns `{ current, latest, url, newer }`; versions are compared part by part, so `26.10.1` is newer than `26.9.24`. Nothing is downloaded or installed — the reader gets a link. |

The check runs at most once a day, silently unless there is something to say, and by hand from the palette. Running it in the main process keeps `connect-src` on the renderer limited to the catalog host.

---

## 9d. Distribution

- `electron-builder.yml` publishes to the same repository the desktop update check reads; the tag (`v26.09.24.3`) must match the stamped version, minus the `v`.
- Targets: AppImage, NSIS, dmg + zip. `.deb` and `.rpm` are left out because they require a maintainer address in metadata that ships with every copy.
- Window chrome: the system title bar is hidden only where the system still draws its own buttons — `hiddenInset` on macOS, `titleBarOverlay` on Windows. Linux keeps its title bar; the overlay is not drawn there, and a window with no close button is worse than an extra row. The renderer is told which arrangement it got (`platform.frame`) and reserves the corner.
- Window size, position and maximised state are kept in `userData/window.json`, outside the reader's library: they belong to this installation on this machine, and they are needed before the renderer exists. A position on a display that is no longer attached is discarded.
- `.github/workflows/check.yml` runs the unit tests, the browser suite and the packaged desktop app on every push; `release.yml` builds and publishes installers on a `v*` tag.

---

## 10. Verification performed

Everything below was run by hand during development. What is worth keeping now lives in `test/`, so it runs again on every change:

| Command | What it covers | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `npm test` | 68 unit and boundary tests — parsers, alignment, references, settings, language packs, registry, and the rules that keep `app/` target-agnostic | ~1 s |
| `npm run test:e2e` | 15 ordered checks against the real `dist/web` build in a browser, with the catalog repository answered from generated fixtures: first run, install and read, the reading panel, parallel alignment, three-source names with the canon as the accessible name, language packs fetched once and cached, marks surviving a translation switch, tab reorder and detach leaving nothing behind, sidebar rows and the empty-sidebar rail, search, the narrow layout, reload persistence, the install report, and a damaged copy repairing itself. It ends by asserting that nothing was logged and nothing 404'd but the language pack the fixtures deliberately omit | ~80 s |
| `npm run test:desktop` | The packaged Electron application started under a display: the `app://` protocol, the preload bridge, the shell rendering, and a clean console | ~10 s |
| `npm run test:perf` | Measurements at full size (below) | ~30 s |

The browser driver (`playwright-core` and a Chromium build) is the one thing the unit tests do not need, so it is optional: the suites report why they cannot run and skip rather than fail.

### Measured at full size

Three complete Bibles — the canon's real chapter and verse counts, verses of realistic length — on one machine, so the numbers are for comparison over time rather than a promise:

| | |
|---|---|
| install a 4.0 MB translation | 510 ms |
| install a 10.1 MB translation (Burmese, UTF-8) | 1,178 ms |
| open Psalm 119 (176 verses) | 361 ms |
| next chapter | 63 ms |
| three parallel panes over Psalm 119 | 174 ms |
| scroll that to the end | 426 ms |
| search 93,000 verses across all three | 2,898 ms (results stream as they are found) |
| reload with everything open | 516 ms |

### Earlier, by hand

- `node --test`: 61 tests (parsers, alignment, references, settings, registry, boundaries).
- Web build in Chromium: catalog check against remote shape, install of three translations through the worker, reader with story headings / titles / merged labels / cross-reference navigation, parallel alignment, command palette, reload persistence, offline reload through the service worker; no console errors.
- Settings in Chromium: persistence across reload; export file contents; import into a clean profile restoring position and installing the two listed translations; a foreign file refused with a clear message; IndexedDB v1 → v2 upgrade keeping an existing translation record.
- Ported shell in Chromium: chrome renders (ribbon, both sidebars, workspace, status bar), books tree with chapter chips, Library and Settings as tabs, reading with story headings / verse titles / merged "17–18" labels / resolved references, parallel panes aligned to the pixel across a merge, synchronised scrolling landing on the same verse, quick switcher, command palette, hash routing, theme cycling and reload restoring the passage; no console errors.
- Search, notes and bookmarks in Chromium: scans over the real Tedim and NIV data (timings above), phrase queries, streamed results grouped by chapter, jump-and-flash from a result, verse bar actions, a bookmark and note surviving a translation switch and a reload, export carrying them, import into a clean profile restoring them, and the IndexedDB v2 → v3 upgrade keeping existing translations and settings.
- Workspace and chrome in Chromium: ribbon and status bar toggles, sidebar drag (264 → 344 px) and `Ctrl+B`, reading panel (size, line height, layout), source mode round trip and a refused scripture edit, tab reorder, detach into a float (with a doc inside), float move and dock, pane swap, and a reload restoring tabs, typography, widths and panes.
- Study features in Chromium: composer opens (`Ctrl+J`), autosaves, renders wikilinks and tags in preview and closes back into the same note; the tags pane lists and filters by tag; the links pane reports linked and unlinked mentions; the outline lists a chapter's headings; the notes manager filters, sorts and exports; the link graph builds from notes, bookmarks and cross references and simulates without burning frames when hidden; the board adds, edits, moves and clears cards; the ink layer attaches over the reading surface, draws, and its strokes reach the `records` store; the verse bar carries note, bookmark, copy, compose, read aloud and verse card; a reading plan starts and shows today's chapters. No console errors.
- Dragging in Chromium, after the capture fix: a sidebar pane tab moved from the left strip to the right and persisted as `panesRight`, pane tabs reordered within a strip, a tab pulled out into a float, the float dragged back over the strip (dock hint shown) and docked, the float's size readout during a resize, and the reading panel staying still while its own controls are clicked.
- Sidebar rows in Chromium: a pane dropped into a row body split the sidebar into two rows with their own strips, both panes visible at once, the divider traded height between them (433/433 → 273/593) and persisted; a pane dragged to the other sidebar kept its mounted state; the arrangement survived a reload.
- Tab dragging in Chromium, after the rewrite: reorder committed and persisted, a second drag immediately after still worked, nothing left behind (no caret, no body class), detach showed the window preview and detached, and the float docked back.
- Status bar, help and pickers in Chromium: word and verse counts for the chapter in view (787 words, 30 verses), storage readout with quota and eviction state in its tooltip, Help with 11 task cards, Shortcuts generated from the registry with its filter, About reporting the build and what is stored, the breadcrumb picker listing 39 books then 40 chapters and navigating, scroll fades setting their variables, and the accent picker surviving a reload.
- Typography and script in Chromium: the reading panel's stepper, slider and number field each move the rendered text (the variables had been landing on the body, where the ramp could not see them); a Burmese translation renders at `lang="my"` with a Myanmar face and 1.26× the reader's line height, and the reading panel still moves that; testament names, book names, tabs, breadcrumbs and the books tree all read in the translation's language.
- Chrome states in Chromium: on a document tab, four status-bar controls and the chapter-only ribbon buttons are disabled and `body[data-tab]` reads `doc`; a detached window resized to 540×440 reopened at 540×440, and again at 540×440 after a reload.
- Script and chrome in Chromium: with a Burmese translation primary, tab 30 px, breadcrumb 22 px and tree row 26 px — the same as in Latin — with chapter numbers in Burmese digits (`၃`, `၃/၅၀`) in the tabs, breadcrumbs, tree and picker.
- Library, sidebars and narrow layout in Chromium: filter (64 → 11 translations), the three views, the offline view; a sidebar emptied of every pane showing a 132 px drop rail mid-drag and taking a pane back; at 720 px the navigation pill, the app pill, a single visible tab with its switcher (5 entries), the left drawer opening and the scrim closing it, and the drawer released on the way back to a wide window.
- Language packs in Chromium: with the Danish and Burmese translations installed, one request per language (`dan`, `mya`), both cached under `lang:` and none re-requested after a reload; `Danske / Det Gamle Testamente / Første Mosebog / 20` and `ယုဒသန် / ဓမ္မဟောင်းကျမ်း / ကမ္ဘာဦးကျမ်း / ၂၀` in the crumb bar, each crumb carrying `Old Testament`, `Genesis`, `Genesis 20` as its accessible name, and the same on tabs, tree rows and chapter chips.
- Desktop build in Electron 44 (Xvfb): `app://lai` origin, bridge present, no Node in renderer, desktop theme applied, install, export through a stubbed save dialog, path traversal refused, and every ported pane and verse action present.
